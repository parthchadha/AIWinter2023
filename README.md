# 🎄 AIWinter2023 🏂

## Topics of interest:

1. Write tutorials on OAI Triton based implementation of important LLM optimizations to make GPUs go brrr (and to deeply understand the algorithms).
2. Reading/reimplementing papers on scaling LLMs, LLMs + Biology.
3. Build tools to efficiently use LLMs as agents for smaller repeatable day-to-day tasks.
